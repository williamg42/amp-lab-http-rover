## Installation

Please view the [Getting Started](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/first-time-setup.html) documentation from Onion to learn how to initially configure your device.

There is an [easy guide](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/connecting-to-wifi-networks-command-line.html) for configuring your network connection provided by Onion.

One that is done, follow the following procedure.

- Connect to your Onion device over WiFi.

```
vi /etc/opkg.conf
```

- delete line â€˜option check_signature 1'


-Download the repository
```
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/williamg42/amp-lab-http-rover/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -xvzf master.tar.gz
```

-Navigate into the directory
 ```
cd amp-lab-http-rover
```

-Run the install script
```
sh ./install.sh
```

-start Python:
```
python main.py [left_motor_pin] [right_motor_pin]
```
Where `left_motor_pin` and `right_motor_pin` are substituted with the correct values.

## Usage

Navigate to port 80 of the IP address of the Onion device in a web browser. Your URL should resemble the follwoing: `http://192.168.0.1:8000`.
