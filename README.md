## Installation

Please view the [Getting Started](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/first-time-setup.html) documentation from Onion to learn how to initially configure your device.

There is an [easy guide](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/connecting-to-wifi-networks-command-line.html) for configuring your network connection provided by Onion.

One that is done, follow the following procedure.

- Connect to your Onion device over WiFi.
- Set up python-light and bottle:
```
vi /etc/opkg.conf
```
— delete line ‘option check_signature 1'

Run the install script
```
sh ./install.sh
```
- Navigate into the directory and start Python:
```
cd amp-lab-http-rover
python main.py [left_motor_pin] [right_motor_pin]
```
Where `left_motor_pin` and `right_motor_pin` are substituted with the correct values.

## Usage

Navigate to port 80 of the IP address of the Onion device in a web browser. Your URL should resemble the follwoing: `http://192.168.0.1:8000`.
